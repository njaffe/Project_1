## Clean Code:
* Effective use of functions
* Clear function/variable names

## Good Documentation:
* Suggest using markdown cells for further explanation of workflow
* Uses comments and docstrings purposefully
* Not especially clear where the challenges end and the project begins in the notebook.

## Proper Data Science:
* Plots are a little cramped or effortful to interpret without cleaner labeling
* Nice integration of external data sources
* Reasonable analysis and conclusions

## Comments:
* Clean, clear individual cells
* Effective use of additional data and libraries
* I think there's a lot left on the table re: exploration of times and other data in the initial set that's perhaps overlooked in favor of bringing additional sources
